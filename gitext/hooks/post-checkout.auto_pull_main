# Automatically doing a git pull when switching to the main branch
# This might fail if your repo is not clean! In that case you might want to git stash.

# To enable this hook, change file name to `post-checkout`

# Get the name of the current branch
branch=$(git symbolic-ref --short HEAD)

# If the current branch is "main", do a "git pull"
if [ "$branch" == "main" ]; then
            git pull
